# Introduction — Two Maps of Experience

The Qualian Codex is an attempt to describe reality using **two complementary maps**:

- One map describes **experience as it is lived**.
- One map describes **structure and constraints** that shape that experience.

Neither map is sufficient on its own.

Used together, they allow us to navigate:
- consciousness,
- perception,
- belief,
- systems,
- and artificial intelligence  
with more clarity than either philosophy or science alone.

## Map One: Experience

The first map starts from the inside.

It describes:
- awareness,
- perception,
- meaning,
- identity,
- and felt reality.

This map asks questions like:
- *What is it like to experience something?*
- *How does meaning arise?*
- *Why does attention shape reality?*

This map does not begin with particles or equations.  
It begins with **what is undeniable: experience itself**.

## Map Two: Structure and Constraints

The second map starts from the outside.

It describes:
- physical laws,
- biological limits,
- neural systems,
- information flows,
- and artificial systems.

This map asks questions like:
- *What limits are acting here?*
- *What structures make this outcome likely?*
- *What patterns repeat across domains?*

This map does not begin with feelings.  
It begins with **what can be measured and modeled**.

## Why Two Maps Are Needed

Most worldviews choose one map and reject the other.

Some reduce everything to matter and mechanism.  
Some reduce everything to mind and meaning.

Both approaches fail in the same way:
they ignore half of reality.

The Qualian Codex treats experience and structure as **co-arising**:

- Experience without structure is incoherent.
- Structure without experience is meaningless.

Reality appears where they meet.

## What This Project Is

The Qualian Codex is:

- a conceptual framework,
- a navigation system,
- and a growing library of models.

It is not a belief system.  
It does not ask for faith.  
It asks for **comparison, testing, and refinement**.

It draws from:
- philosophy,
- neuroscience,
- physics,
- systems theory,
- and artificial intelligence  
without belonging to any one of them.

## How to Use This Site

If you are new:

1. Start with **Start Here**.
2. Read this Introduction.
3. Use the **QC Assistant** for guided exploration.

If you are technical:

- Explore the structure and constraint models.
- Treat this as an experimental framework.

If you are philosophical:

- Treat this as a map of experience and meaning.

If you are curious:

- Treat this as a lens to look through.

## A Simple Guiding Rule

> If something can be experienced, it belongs to the experiential map.  
> If something can be measured, it belongs to the structural map.  
> Most things belong to both.

The Codex exists to study the space between them.

## What Comes Next

The rest of the Codex develops:

- how experience arises,
- how constraints shape outcomes,
- how belief stabilizes perception,
- and how artificial systems mirror these processes.

This is not a finished system.

It is a **living model**.

And you are now at the entry point.
