# Analyzer Lite (CCM)

Analyzer Lite is a plain-language diagnostic that converts a written problem into a Constraint Stack summary.

## What you write

Write 4–8 sentences describing:
1) what is happening,
2) what you want to change,
3) what seems to block change,
4) what you have already tried.

## What you get back

A structured output in four parts:

1) **Observed Outcome (S)** — what is actually happening.
2) **Constraints (C)** — likely constraints causing the outcome.
3) **Levers (L)** — smallest actions that can change the constraint profile.
4) **Next Experiment (E)** — one low-risk test to run within 24–72 hours.
