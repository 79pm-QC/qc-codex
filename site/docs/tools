# Analyzer Lite (CCM)

Analyzer Lite is a **plain-language diagnostic** that converts a written problem into a **Constraint Stack** summary.

It is designed for:
- people new to the method,
- fast triage before deeper analysis,
- public-facing use (no maths required).

---

## What you write

Write 4–8 sentences describing:
1) what is happening,
2) what you want to change,
3) what seems to block change,
4) what you have already tried.

---

## What you get back

A structured output in four parts:

1) **Observed Outcome (S)**  
   What is actually happening (behaviour / experience / decision pattern).

2) **Dominant Constraints (Top 3–5)**  
   The constraints most likely shaping the outcome.

3) **Constraint Stack (Public View)**  
   A simplified stack view (Physical → Cognitive → Meaning).

4) **Next Intervention (I)**  
   1–3 changes to test (small, reversible, measurable).

---

## The CCM Public Stack

This is the simplified public-facing version used by Analyzer Lite.

- **Physical constraints**  
  Laws, matter/energy limits, environment, time, resources.

- **Cognitive constraints**  
  Biology, brain architecture, attention limits, memory, information access.

- **Meaning constraints**  
  Emotion, belief/expectation, identity, social context, values.

**Rule of thumb:**  
If it can’t happen in the world → Physical.  
If it can’t be processed reliably → Cognitive.  
If it won’t be allowed/selected internally → Meaning.

## How the model works

### Collapse (Φ)
A final outcome is a **selection under constraints**.

- The constraints **bound** or **bias** what gets selected.
- Some constraints are “hard bounds” (physics), others are “soft filters” (belief/identity).

### Diagnostics (Φ⁻¹)
From an outcome, we infer likely constraints.

- If the same outcome repeats, the constraints are probably stable.
- If it changes quickly with context, constraints are likely meaning/social.
- If it changes with rest/health, constraints are likely cognitive/biological.

### Intervention (I)
Change one constraint at a time.
Prefer interventions that are:
- small,
- reversible,
- measurable within 24–72 hours.

## Analyzer Lite Template

Copy/paste and fill in:

### Input
**Situation summary:**  
(4–8 sentences)

**What I want instead:**  
(1–2 sentences)

**What seems to block it:**  
(bullets)

**What I already tried:**  
(bullets)

### Output (what Analyzer Lite will produce)
**S — Observed outcome:**  

**Top constraints (3–5):**  
1)  
2)  
3)  
4)  
5)  

**Stack placement (Public View):**
- Physical:  
- Cognitive:  
- Meaning:  

**I — Next interventions (1–3 tests):**
1)  
2)  
3)  

**Success signal (how we’ll know it helped):**
-

## Worked Example (short)

### Input
**Situation summary:**  
“I keep delaying an important project. I plan it repeatedly but don’t start. I feel pressure and then avoid. When I do begin, I work well, but I rarely reach that point. This has been going on for months.”

**What I want instead:**  
“Start within 10 minutes on most days and make steady progress.”

**What seems to block it:**  
- dread before starting  
- perfectionism  
- unclear first step

**What I already tried:**  
- to-do lists  
- motivational videos  
- working late

### Output (example)
**S — Observed outcome:**  
Avoidance loop before initiation; work quality OK after starting.

**Top constraints (3–5):**
1) Meaning: perfection/identity stakes (“if I start, I’m judged”)  
2) Meaning: threat emotion (dread)  
3) Cognitive: task-initiation friction (unclear first step)  
4) Cognitive: attention volatility (start requires high control)  
5) Physical: time placement (late work increases fatigue)

**Stack placement (Public View):**
- Physical: fatigue/time placement  
- Cognitive: unclear first step, attention friction  
- Meaning: perfection stakes, dread

**I — Next interventions (1–3 tests):**
1) Write the first step as a 2-minute action and do only that.  
2) Redefine “start” as “produce an ugly draft” (reduce identity stake).  
3) Move start time earlier by 30 minutes for 3 days (lower fatigue).

**Success signal:**
- started within 10 minutes on 3 out of 5 days

## Disclaimer (important)

Analyzer Lite is a **structuring tool**, not medical or mental-health advice.  
If you have symptoms that may require clinical support, use this tool alongside a qualified professional.
